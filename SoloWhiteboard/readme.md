# Solo Whiteboard interview

## Introduction

I found this challenge on code wars at [link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5442e4fc7fc447653a0000d5/train/javascript)
and elected to make a few changes to make it harder, the most notable of which is that I'm tasked with finding the first match and finding the distance of those indices .

I found this surprisingly difficult with my added constraints, and although its far from optimal and bug free, I feel I'm easily 85% of the way there.
