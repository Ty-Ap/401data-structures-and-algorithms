# SquareChecker

## Problem Domain

Given the area and side length of a square, this function determines if the square is valid. A square is considered valid if the area and side length are both positive numbers and the area is equal to the square of the side length.

## Step Through

1. Check if the area and side length are both positive numbers.
2. Calculate the square of the side length.
3. Compare the calculated square with the given area.
4. Return true if the area and the calculated square are equal and if the guard clause is passed, otherwise return false.
