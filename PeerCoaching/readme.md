# Peer Coaching

today for code challenge I proctored and helped a John Chavez through the hashtable/repeatingword challenge and whitebaord, and shared my process of problem solving and brainstorming. This started at around 130 and went on till 415. I feel we both got quite a lot out of it. Teaching helped solidify some of my learnings, and John was very appreciative of our time. I think we both learned a lot from each other. I think this is a great way to learn and grow as a developer. I would like to do this more often. I explained how I make myself care about and give context to data structure problems, and how I use my patented Slowbrain Fastbrain technique.

## Challenge

Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter. Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string. 

## Approach & Efficiency

John used a hashtable to store the words and their frequency. John then looped through the hashtable and returned the first word that had a frequency greater than 1.
